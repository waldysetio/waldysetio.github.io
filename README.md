1. **Problem**: There has been a significant customer churn in an energy company that provides corporates with gas and electricity utility particularly in its SME (Small and Medium Entreprise) segment due to new power liberalization of the energy market. The company wants to know whether it's possible to predict customers likely to churn using predictive model and what factors that drive the churn.

- Historical customer data: Customer data such as usage, sign up date, forecasted usage, etc.
- Historical pricing data: variable and fixed pricing data, etc.
